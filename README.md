# Chip8-Interpreter
Another Chip8 emulator. I made it in C++ with SDL3.

# Need to build it to run it
Build with ```cmake -S . -B build```, then run ```cmake --build build```, exe to run it should be in build folder.

# Still some bugs
There is no sound, I plan on adding this and fixing some bugs later.
